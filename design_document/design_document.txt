Class: Linear Equation (calculates properties of a line given two points)
Instance variables: int x1, y1, x2, y2 (coordinates of the two points)
double slope (slope of the line)
double yIntercept (the b in y = mx + b)
double distance (distance between two points)

Constructor: publicLinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
(initializes point, calculates slope, y-intercept, distance)

Methods: private void calculateSlope() ((y2-y1)/(x2-x1))
private void calculateYIntercept() (y1-(slope * x1))
private void calculateDistance() (distance = square root of ((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2))
public string getEquation()  (returns y = mx + b format)
public string coordinateForX(double x value) (takes a double x value and returns the y coordinate)
public double getDistance() (returns the distance between two points)
public String toString() (returns all the calculations and stuff)

Class: EquationRunner
First it asks for input from the user for the two coordinate points
Next it constructs a Linear Equation object based on the input coordinates
Prints all the values
Then it asks for another x value
It displays the point (x, y)
